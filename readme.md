### Provide a high-level summary of your Project.

We have often talked about how incredible it was going into space and reach Mars with current technology.
But have we thought about maintaining communication in real time with the astronauts who are in the outer space?
THE NEAREST SPACE is especially focused on meeting these expectations to establish an interconnection with astronauts from one planet to another through a web application that allows to send messages in real time.
This includes an action which allows to know at what time of the year the connection with users of planet Earth will be established. This App will list names with different similarities and in this way, it is possible to meet the objective set.

### Describe how your Project addresses this challenge

THE NEAREST SPACE will cover a long-term problem, which is the communication between Mars and Earth. In the future, colonies on Mars will be possible, and the problems that astronauts will have to deal with are, are their impossibility to communicate with their families, so the objective is to establish communication through a web application created with the MERN stack, whose base language is Javascript. On the client side, we use Framework React.js, on the server side Node.js with the Framework Express.js and as a DB database manager.
Its main function will be to communicate and interconnect with family or friends between Earth and Mars.

### Describe how you developed your Project

Nowadays, the advances in space exploration have inspired many people, including our team. We focused especially on analyzing the situation in which astronauts find themselves when they are in the outer space. There is a lack of communication between the central plant, and family and friends. It is very important for us to provide a solution for this problem.

The tools used in this web application were with the MERN stack whose base language is Javascript, on the client side we use Framework React.js, on the server side Node.js with the Framework Express.js and as a database manager Mongo DB.
One of the challenges that the team had to address was to find a way to use the data provided by the associated space agencies, and on the other hand, one of the achievements was to find a lot of information about Mars, to know everything that is known about this planet so far.

### How did you use space agency data in your project

The associated space agencies provide relevant data for the implementation of this project, in this case we use InSight: Mars Weather Service API, to obtain the meteorological measurements of Mars, Temperature, wind speed and atmospheric pressure. According to these return parameters from the API, it is possible to know how it interferes in the communication of both planets, so our users will know when it will be the right moment to communicate, and thus, they will be able to have an idea of ​​how survival is carried out there, due to the conditions under which they are exposed. It is crucial for the people of earth to know more about Mars, since it is a planet that can be colonized.
